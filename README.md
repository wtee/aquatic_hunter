#Aquatic Hunter
A quick mock-up of a phone app meant to make it easier to identify and report aquatic invasive species. Made as part of [Hack2O](http://workup.cc/hack2o/).

For more information, you can view our group's presentation on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmF7Oj-Y_KQ).

A live demo can be found [here](http://www.sometimes-i.com/Aquatic_Hunter). It will look a bit stretched on non-mobile screens.
